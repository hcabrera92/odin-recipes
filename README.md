Dairy of Noob Coder 

17/10/2023 

The Odin Project has been really interesting to me, I've retaken this course almost five years later since I first started. My main objective is to become a FEWD learn a lot of new and exciting coding tips.

On the past days I've managed to understad better a lot of Git, which is mind blowing to me. I believe there is lot to learn and I'm really excited about what the future holds.

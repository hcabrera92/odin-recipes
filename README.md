Dairy of Noob Coder 

17/10/2023 

The Odin Project has been really interesting to me, I've retaken this course almost five years later since I first started. My main objective is to become a FEWD learn a lot of new and exciting coding tips.

On the past days I've managed to understad better a lot of Git, which is mind blowing to me. I believe there is lot to learn and I'm really excited about what the future holds.

Today, I had the opportunity to apply a significant (I would;nt say significant after all, but hey everything counts right?) amount of CSS, thanks to The Odin Project. It's always rejuvenating to revisit familiar concepts and realize that there is still much to learn. It's quite satisfying to work through problems, verify the solutions, and discover that they are indeed correct.
